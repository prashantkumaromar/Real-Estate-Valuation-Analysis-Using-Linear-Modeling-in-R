# Real-Estate-Valuation-Analysis-Using-Linear-Modeling-in-R
This R project analyzes real estate valuation, using a dataset with details like house age, distance to MRT stations, and convenience stores. It involves data preparation, exploratory analysis, linear modeling, and cross-validation techniques for developing predictive models of house prices, evaluated by Mean Squared Error.


## Overview
This R project analyzes real estate valuation, using a dataset with details like house age, distance to MRT stations, and convenience stores. It involves data preparation, exploratory analysis, linear modeling, and cross-validation techniques for developing predictive models of house prices, evaluated by Mean Squared Error.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of real estate properties such as transaction dates, house age, proximity to MRT stations, number of convenience stores, and geographical coordinates.

## Methods
- Data Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Residual Analysis
- Cross-Validation
