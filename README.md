# Real-Estate-Valuation-Analysis-Using-Linear-Modeling-in-R
This R project analyzes real estate valuation, using a dataset with details like house age, distance to MRT stations, and convenience stores. It involves data preparation, exploratory analysis, linear modeling, and cross-validation techniques for developing predictive models of house prices, evaluated by Mean Squared Error.

## Overview
This project is a detailed data analysis and modeling endeavor in R, focusing on real estate valuation. It utilizes a dataset encompassing attributes such as transaction dates, house age, distance to MRT stations, number of convenience stores, geographic coordinates, and house prices per unit area.

## Structure of Analysis

### Data Preparation
- Loading and cleaning the dataset.
- Renaming columns for clarity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing and statistically analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and variable relationships.

### Model Development and Analysis
- Developing various linear models to understand relationships between house prices and dataset features.
- Includes both simple and multiple linear regression models.

### Residual Analysis
- Thorough examination of linear model residuals to validate model assumptions and limitations.

### Cross-Validation Techniques
- Employing methods like Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and K-fold cross-validation for model performance evaluation.

### Comparative Model Evaluation
- Using advanced regression techniques such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS).
- Models are compared based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Output and Interpretation
- Presenting statistical model outputs and their performance metrics.
- Analyzing results to derive insights into factors affecting real estate prices.

## Target Audience
This project is ideal for data analysts, real estate market analysts, and researchers focusing on applying statistical methods to real-world data.

## Installation and Usage
Please ensure R and the required packages are installed for running the project scripts.
